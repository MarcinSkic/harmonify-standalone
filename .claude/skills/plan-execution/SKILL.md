# Plan Execution Workflow

## 0. Determine scope

Identify which part of the project the plan targets:

- **Frontend** — Vue components, stores, TypeScript, styles, routing → work in `harmonify-frontend/`
- **Backend** — C# endpoints, services, models, .csproj → work in `harmonify-music-server/`
- **Both** — changes span both repos

If it's clearly one or the other from the plan content or user's wording, proceed. If unclear, ask using AskUserQuestion:

> "Którego projektu dotyczy ten plan?"
> Options: Frontend / Backend / Obu

Scope determines:
- Which directory to `cd` into for commands
- Which lint/build/test commands to run (see below)
- Where `.claude/.plans/` files live

**Frontend commands:** `pnpm lint:fix`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm vitest run`
**Backend commands:** `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`

## 1. Ensure a detailed plan exists

- Plans are located in `.claude/.plans/` inside the relevant sub-repo. **Never** use `~/.claude/plans/` or the plan-mode default path.
- **Do not write any code without a detailed implementation plan.** A plan must specify:
  - Concrete phases/steps with clear scope
  - Which files to create, modify, or delete
  - Key implementation details (data structures, APIs, component interfaces)
  - Dependencies between phases
- If the user provides a plan file — read it fully and verify it has enough detail. If anything is ambiguous or under-specified, **ask the user to clarify before proceeding**.
- If no plan exists — **write one first** in `.claude/.plans/`, and present it to the user for review. Do not start coding until the user approves the plan.
- If the plan is high-level/vague (only goals, no implementation details) — expand it into a detailed implementation plan, ask the user to confirm, and only then proceed.
- **Where to save the expanded plan**: write the detailed plan back into the **same starter file** the user pointed at, replacing or augmenting its content. Preserve the original brief at the top of the file as context. Do **not** save the expanded plan to a different location — even if plan mode suggests one.

## 2. Branch check

Check with `git status` what branch you're on:
- If it matches the plan scope — proceed
- If not — ask the user whether to create a new branch or switch to an existing one
- **Never work on main** unless explicitly told otherwise

## 3. Execution mode

When the plan is split into phases, ask the user before starting:
1. **Pause after each phase** — commit, let user review, then continue
2. **Execute the whole plan** — work through all phases, commit at the end

## 4. During execution

**Frontend:**
- After writing or modifying code, run `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix lint issues — never fix ESLint errors manually
- Run `pnpm type-check` after significant changes to catch type errors early
- If a phase has related tests, run them with `pnpm vitest run <path>` before moving on

**Backend:**
- Run `dotnet build` after significant changes to catch compilation errors early
- Run `dotnet test` if there are relevant tests

## 5. Committing

**Always stop and ask the user before creating a commit.** Never commit automatically. Present a summary of changes and wait for approval. Point 3 defines *how often* to commit (per phase or at the end), but the user always confirms each commit.

## 6. After completing all work

**Frontend:**
- Run `pnpm lint:fix` on the full project
- Run `pnpm type-check` to verify no type errors remain
- Run `pnpm vitest run` if there are relevant unit tests

**Backend:**
- Run `dotnet build` to verify everything compiles

Summarize what was done and any deviations from the plan.
